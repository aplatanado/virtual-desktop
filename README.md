## Installation

Run these commands in a terminal:

~~~
sudo install -m755 scripts/start-virtual-desktop /usr/local/bin
sudo install -m755 libvirt-hooks/qemu /etc/libvirt/hooks
~~~

## Add a desktop shortcut

Create a desktop file (e.g. virtual-desktop.desktop) with the following content and put it in your desktop folder
or in ~/.local/share/applications, if you want to add it as a desktop menu entry.

~~~
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Virtual Desktop
GenericName=Windows virtual desktop launcher
Exec=/usr/local/bin/start-virtual-desktop --desktop hoth
Icon=virt-manager
Terminal=true
Type=Application
Categories=System;Office;Game
~~~

Remember change the Exec line so that it points to the path of `start-virtual-desktop` script. And replace
'hoth' with the name of your virtual machine.
